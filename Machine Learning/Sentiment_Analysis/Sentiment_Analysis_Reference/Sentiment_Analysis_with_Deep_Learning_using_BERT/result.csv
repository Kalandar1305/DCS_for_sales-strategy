flipkart,Aroma NB120 Tehalka - 28 Hours Playtime Bluetooth Neckband Bluetooth Headset,3.8,Wonderful,"I got this product at the price of 230 and am saying this is really worthy for its price tag. Sound quality is good but bass is little bit extra. Battery backup is good I listen music for a day with only single charge, so battery backup is good. You can go with it if its costing you around 300 - 400 and if its reaching the price of 500+ you can buy Croma or Oneplus. Overall a good product from Aroma for its price range.",5.0,22

If used with correct equaliser settings(i use poweramp player with boosted bass), the bass is awesome and non distorted at high volumes also. Touch controls are a complete letdown, i use it only to wakeup the xpods when they are off due to non usage, else they are not so responsive. Mic quality is just ok in silent environment and the communication works. Charges quickly and gives good battery backup as promised. At half volume also its loud enough. Case is very small and handy.

flipkart,"OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 with Fast Charge, 30 Hrs Battery Life, Earphones with mic Bluetooth Headset",4.2,Mind-blowing purchase,"This is worth every penny you spend. I doesn't disappoint in any way. Delivery was 2 days and charged it before using and I have been using it for 10 hours straight and its still 90% charge. I don't know currently how much time it would last, though I won't count till then because I trust the brand and so far battery looks awesome. The sound quality is different from the boat rockerz I was using as it consists more mettalic type of bass and it feels amazing. Its easy to use, by just seperating the ear pieces from each others magnetic connection it boots up and connects quickly even when you are using other than a one plus mobile phone. Build quality is awesome and it doesn't come out of ears and it fits perfectly, I sometimes forget I have put it in ears. I didn't test the full 0-100 charge but I did 80-100% and it happened in just 10minutes. It's a longlife product and go for it 👍",5.0,651

flipkart,"OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 with Fast Charge, 30 Hrs Battery Life, Earphones with mic Bluetooth Headset",4.2,Moderate,1. In terms of build quality: poor. Oneplus Bullets wireless  z was 10 times better then this. Price was same of this. But that was more comfortable around your neck & the quality of rubbing so good. But in this one you will find no difference between Oneplus and any other brand's neck band. 2. Connectivity: I bought it recently 2 days back and I'm already facing connectivity issue. After detaching these ear burds it should be auto connect to your phone but sometimes it's not working. Also it's taking longer time to connect with phone. Previous model of these I mean oneplus bullets wireless z was so much perfect in everything. I don't know why you guys remove that model. Over All I don't like it at all,2.0,22
flipkart,"OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 with Fast Charge, 30 Hrs Battery Life, Earphones with mic Bluetooth Headset",4.2,Fabulous!,Sound quality is good but on full volume trouble feels on high side mid volume bass and trouble sounds up to the mark you can't differentiate sound with wired earphone or OnePlus bullets z2 on 70-80% volume if you love bass music like then go for it ! Battery backup is excellent ☺️ charge for 10 minutes and it last for 16 to 18 hours easily ❤️ in bulid quality it feels premium and light weight for sure 😊 Cons : 1. If you have old device or without Dolby Atmos then the sound quality feels like 1k Bluetooth neckband,5.0,29

I don't know currently how much time it would last, though I won't count till then because I trust the brand and so far battery looks awesome. The sound quality is different from the boat rockerz I was using as it consists more mettalic type of bass and it feels amazing. Its easy to use, by just seperating the ear pieces from each others magnetic connection it boots up and connects quickly even when you are using other than a one plus mobile phone. Build quality is awesome and it doesn't come out of ears and it fits perfectly, I sometimes forget I have put it in ears. I didn't test the full 0-100 charge but I did 80-100% and it happened in just 10minutes. It's a longlife product and go for it 👍",5.0,651

And most of all the battery life is good from the last version ( base edition) but not as good as they are claiming 30 hours , it is hardly giving 15-16hours battery backup .

flipkart,OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Mind-blowing purchase,"This is worth every penny you spend. I doesn't disappoint in any way. Delivery was 2 days and charged it before using and I have been using it for 10 hours straight and its still 90% charge. I don't know currently how much time it would last, though I won't count till then because I trust the brand and so far battery looks awesome. The sound quality is different from the boat rockerz I was using as it consists more mettalic type of bass and it feels amazing. Its easy to use, by just seperating the ear pieces from each others magnetic connection it boots up and connects quickly even when you are using other than a one plus mobile phone. Build quality is awesome and it doesn't come out of ears and it fits perfectly, I sometimes forget I have put it in ears. I didn't test the full 0-100 charge but I did 80-100% and it happened in just 10minutes. It's a longlife product and go for it 👍",5.0,651
flipkart,OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Does the job,"As a matter of giving review about this product , i m using dis from three week so giving 3 out of 5 because one plus didn't improve the sound quality at all , they r giving same sound quality as the previous version except the bass , bass is Little bit high . And most of all the battery life is good from the last version ( base edition) but not as good as they are claiming 30 hours , it is hardly giving 15-16hours battery backup . That's why I am giving the 3 stars . For same sound quality as the previous version and 15-16hrs battery life... Btw thanks Flipkart",3.0,122

flipkart,OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Moderate,1. In terms of build quality: poor. Oneplus Bullets wireless  z was 10 times better then this. Price was same of this. But that was more comfortable around your neck & the quality of rubbing so good. But in this one you will find no difference between Oneplus and any other brand's neck band. 2. Connectivity: I bought it recently 2 days back and I'm already facing connectivity issue. After detaching these ear burds it should be auto connect to your phone but sometimes it's not working. Also it's taking longer time to connect with phone. Previous model of these I mean oneplus bullets wireless z was so much perfect in everything. I don't know why you guys remove that model. Over All I don't like it at all,2.0,22
flipkart,OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Fabulous!,Sound quality is good but on full volume trouble feels on high side mid volume bass and trouble sounds up to the mark you can't differentiate sound with wired earphone or OnePlus bullets z2 on 70-80% volume if you love bass music like then go for it ! Battery backup is excellent ☺️ charge for 10 minutes and it last for 16 to 18 hours easily ❤️ in bulid quality it feels premium and light weight for sure 😊 Cons : 1. If you have old device or without Dolby Atmos then the sound quality feels like 1k Bluetooth neckband,5.0,29
flipkart,OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Great product,"Totally,Worth the amount!!! 💯💯💯 I am fully satisfied with the product ❤😍.

Awesome battery packup lasts easily for 2 days after full charge. I mostly charge for just 10-15mins with OnePlus Warp charger and use it for the whole day. The charging speed depends on your charger output. The charging port type is C. If you don't have type C cable then don't worry you'll get a small type C cable inside the box that you can use with any charging adaptor. Sound quality is good and connectivity is superb. Only small drawback is the build, compared to its predecessor the build quality feels slightly cheaper. Still better than realme, mi bands. It's worth 2k, grab it!",5.0,16

flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Good choice,"Just got my hands on this product. Let me be honest. Build quality pretty good. Everything fine no cracks or openings. Now the most important point - Bass. I have seen many people and many YouTubers telling that bass is bit much. For for me it is pretty well balanced and works out pretty well. I cannot tell much about battery backup. Let me use this for a couple of days. Then I will update my post. Sound quality also good and if you are used to listening to high volume of sound, you can easily listen at 70 - 80 %. I am happy with this product and my first impressions are good. Don't see any cons right now but I must say that the eartips are a bit hard. But if someone will be using this type of headset for the first time as me and had been using wired headset till now, I don't think it will pose much of a problem. But if you are used to softer eartips then there might be some problem. But not much. Weight is just okay, not very heavy. Won't go with comparison with OnePlus z headset. As I haven't used it. But the product is not that soft and is pretty balanced I think. If you want this headset I will recommend it. I have been using this for 3 days now. I have used it for about 18 hrs. The battery is 60%. And you may have some connectivity issues at large distances or in bad weather. It is not totally hassle free. I now think that I should have brought wired earphones instead. But anyways if you want it you can go for it. But you may have to use equaliser for the vocals to be understood clearly. Bass is very high.",4.0,197

Product material is very poor quality. 2 times broken without doing anything. Plastic quality is very very poor. If you are looking for Better product so please don't buy it. Sound Quality and battery life  is amazing but Product material is very wrost. I can say, This is a best Neckband I have ever seen. I got this product on 16 August evening & I used this Neckband till now continuously but it showing 20% battery. Actually I was confused between One Plus bullet & Boat 255 pro plus. So, I used both but one plus Neckband is looking like cheapest Neckband but Now I am using boat & it's look like an expensive Neckband. So I am highly satisfied with this Neckband. Battery life - 10/10 Design - 10/9 Comfortable - 10/8 Sound - 10/10 Basd - 10/10 Boat service - 11/10 I am using boat products from last 3 years & trust me I am amazed to see the service of boat.

flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Worth the money,After using for more than 10 days I am writing this review... 1.

Battery is long lasting I used for total 12 days after one complete charge and I use it daily for atleast 5-6 hours for official calls. Secondly it takes less then an hour for 100% charge... 4.

flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Good choice,Every thing is just awesome but build quality  of boat products as usual sucks... If handled  carefully  can last about 1 yr or more but not then it can't survive Only go for it if u r not a rough user By seeing its quality  i can say its more durable than its 225 nd 255 pro version but not as durable as realme dizo neckands. So if a heavy user i suggest go for realme Or if u get this at below 1200(in sale/offer ) Then only go for it Other than that i am extremely happy with its mic and sound are just awesome,4.0,24

flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Really Nice,"Reviewing after using for 1 month. Sound quality: Average sound quality. Bass boosted but sound quality degrades in lower frequencies. Loudness: Pretty loud. 25% volume is loud enough for indoors listening. Hardly used over 50% volume. Noise isolation: Decent. Fit: Excellent. Battery: Hats off. Charge it, forget it. Connectivity: Excellent. Signal drops rarely even after 2 walls. Mic: No complaints. Built quality: Below average. Pretty sure the charging port is going to break first. Cables are sturdy though. Design: Dumb design. When the buds are plugged in, the upper button decreases volume and the lower button increases volume. The designers were probably drunk. Magnets: Not very strong. No auto off with magnets. One more thing: The dual connect is a life saver for me. It connects to my laptop and phone simultaneously. If the phone receives a call, it'll automatically pause the laptop media and switch to mobile. Really underrated feature. So conclusion: Pros: Battery life, Connectivity, Dual connect. Sound quality (decent for the price). Cons: Built quality, Design. Looks and feels cheap.",4.0,27

flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Brilliant,"Tip- At first I thought the sound and bass is less, and many here said the same, but the product came with 60 % volume adjusted so when I increased and adjusted  the volume with my phone volume it sounds the best, the battery is beast, I received it two weeks ago and my battery is still at 60 % I haven't charged it yet, as it comes with 100% charge Battery - 10 on 10 Sound - Crystal clear 10 on 10 (boat sound quality) Bass - 9/10 ( I don't want headache from bass so it's perfect for me, it also depends on the track u choose and the volume increase of the headset) Design and build - 10 on 10 durable and flexible, I purchased  Navy Blue because it looks classic Fit - they gives you three size of buds of different sizes, medium was adjusted already but it hurt my ears so I changed it into small and it super comfortable According to my need and choice its Amazing... ❤️Great deal quality product.",5.0,8

flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Wonderful,First of all thanks to Flipkart & Boat. Now discuss about this headphone :- 1.

Battery :- It's have a great 300mah battery. I use 6 days when it was fully charged but till now only 30% battery left.  5/5 star for battery. 5. Value For Money :- I suggest everyone to buy this Bluetooth Neckband ( boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ ). 5/5 star for value for money.,5.0,13

flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Brilliant,Honest review after a week of use... Cons... 1) punchy bass and a very good sound quality Jusy loved it. If you are a bass lover you will love it. 2) The battery backup is just like a legend. Using it since a week Daily full day 8 to 9 hrs on receiving calls and all. Listens music to 3 - 4 hours in a day The battery still lasted 12 days and i had not charged it once in the last 12 days. I'm amazed. Battery backup is marvellous 3) calling is great in it. Mic and call quality is great 4) design is quite good Pros Dont compare them with oneplus bullet wireless or oppo enco m 32 as they are way costly and if you have good budget then go for it but i bet u ll never regreat ordering boat 255 pro +,5.0,4
flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Fair,It's not such a good product not giving any good quality it's one side is always getting broken even if it's getting a little stratched it's not really value for money and the worst part is it's call quality every single background noise is reached to person you are talking to so i don't think you should buy it even music quality is okay and battery is good except that i would never recommend you but some buds in offer you will get good buds in 1200-1500 in place of this that will look cool and work better than this.,3.0,4

flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Super!,"Review after 7days used ..... Sound Quality - 7/10 Bass Quality - 5/10 Battery quality 10/10* Build Quality - 6/10 Design Quality - 6/10 Comfort - 8/10 Fittings - 8/10 In honest review - Sound quality is loud(Not So Much) but bass quality is very low . If you switch from boat wired earphone (like boat 220) then you fill this low sound quality & bass quality. I think need to fix this bass quality ... make it more then high for batter sound experience. Battery quality is so so so good. Use 5days(7-8hour/day) continuously at that time there was 10 percent battery. Call connection & noise cancellation are perfectly working. I haven't see no issues in this neckband . Build quality is ok ok . Not so good, not so bad. Comfort is very good . No issues with me . Earbuds is comfortable for me . Atlast .... Overall best neckband for this price . Need to improve bass quality little more otherwise it is good enough . But use of any good external equaliser app from playstore solve this problem . I love this product so much .",5.0,17

The magnetic lock is not perfect... Magnetic power is little lower. Some features are miss in this headphone ...like in oneplus headphones.. That is automatically off when we lock by magetic in the back of headset. And head phone wire is little long, its length up to your  stomach.",4.0,375
flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Good choice,"Just got my hands on this product. Let me be honest. Build quality pretty good. Everything fine no cracks or openings. Now the most important point - Bass. I have seen many people and many YouTubers telling that bass is bit much. For for me it is pretty well balanced and works out pretty well. I cannot tell much about battery backup. Let me use this for a couple of days. Then I will update my post. Sound quality also good and if you are used to listening to high volume of sound, you can easily listen at 70 - 80 %. I am happy with this product and my first impressions are good. Don't see any cons right now but I must say that the eartips are a bit hard. But if someone will be using this type of headset for the first time as me and had been using wired headset till now, I don't think it will pose much of a problem. But if you are used to softer eartips then there might be some problem. But not much. Weight is just okay, not very heavy. Won't go with comparison with OnePlus z headset. As I haven't used it. But the product is not that soft and is pretty balanced I think. If you want this headset I will recommend it. I have been using this for 3 days now. I have used it for about 18 hrs. The battery is 60%. And you may have some connectivity issues at large distances or in bad weather. It is not totally hassle free. I now think that I should have brought wired earphones instead. But anyways if you want it you can go for it. But you may have to use equaliser for the vocals to be understood clearly. Bass is very high.",4.0,197

flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Wonderful,This neckband looks good for its price especially for the battery backup and fast charging.

Cons are that it doesn't fit that well into the ears and right side feels little heavy cos of remote buttons on the right cable.,4.0,673
flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Mind-blowing purchase,"The battery life is really amazing, on average use of 4-5 hrs per day it lasts upto 5-6 days on 50-60% volume. Also the fast charging really works, you will get 10hrs battery backup with 10 minutes of charge, whereas it takes 1.5 hrs for full charge which is good. The mic does have noise cancellation and quality of voice over mic is very good. The build quality is also nice, it feels durable and the fit is good and snuggly.

Due to to Covid situation Work from home this product is the best support. It connects with my Laptop and mobile at the same time.

Product material is very poor quality. 2 times broken without doing anything. Plastic quality is very very poor. If you are looking for Better product so please don't buy it. Sound Quality and battery life  is amazing but Product material is very wrost. I can say, This is a best Neckband I have ever seen. I got this product on 16 August evening & I used this Neckband till now continuously but it showing 20% battery. Actually I was confused between One Plus bullet & Boat 255 pro plus. So, I used both but one plus Neckband is looking like cheapest Neckband but Now I am using boat & it's look like an expensive Neckband. So I am highly satisfied with this Neckband. Battery life - 10/10 Design - 10/9 Comfortable - 10/8 Sound - 10/10 Basd - 10/10 Boat service - 11/10 I am using boat products from last 3 years & trust me I am amazed to see the service of boat.

flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Good choice,Every thing is just awesome but build quality  of boat products as usual sucks... If handled  carefully  can last about 1 yr or more but not then it can't survive Only go for it if u r not a rough user By seeing its quality  i can say its more durable than its 225 nd 255 pro version but not as durable as realme dizo neckands. So if a heavy user i suggest go for realme Or if u get this at below 1200(in sale/offer ) Then only go for it Other than that i am extremely happy with its mic and sound are just awesome,4.0,24
flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Terrific purchase,Good Product long lasting battery But when i compare it with my Infinity glide 120 the sound and bass are better there alas the its battery is only 6hrs so if you need good voice with better build quality with less battery go with glide 120 but if you.need A little less audio not much just a little and way long lasting battery go with this one,5.0,32

flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Really Nice,"Reviewing after using for 1 month. Sound quality: Average sound quality. Bass boosted but sound quality degrades in lower frequencies. Loudness: Pretty loud. 25% volume is loud enough for indoors listening. Hardly used over 50% volume. Noise isolation: Decent. Fit: Excellent. Battery: Hats off. Charge it, forget it. Connectivity: Excellent. Signal drops rarely even after 2 walls. Mic: No complaints. Built quality: Below average. Pretty sure the charging port is going to break first. Cables are sturdy though. Design: Dumb design. When the buds are plugged in, the upper button decreases volume and the lower button increases volume. The designers were probably drunk. Magnets: Not very strong. No auto off with magnets. One more thing: The dual connect is a life saver for me. It connects to my laptop and phone simultaneously. If the phone receives a call, it'll automatically pause the laptop media and switch to mobile. Really underrated feature. So conclusion: Pros: Battery life, Connectivity, Dual connect. Sound quality (decent for the price). Cons: Built quality, Design. Looks and feels cheap.",4.0,27

flipkart,boAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ with ASAP Charge and upto 40 Hours Playback Bluetooth Headset,4.2,Brilliant,Honest review after a week of use... Cons... 1) punchy bass and a very good sound quality Jusy loved it. If you are a bass lover you will love it. 2) The battery backup is just like a legend. Using it since a week Daily full day 8 to 9 hrs on receiving calls and all. Listens music to 3 - 4 hours in a day The battery still lasted 12 days and i had not charged it once in the last 12 days. I'm amazed. Battery backup is marvellous 3) calling is great in it. Mic and call quality is great 4) design is quite good Pros Dont compare them with oneplus bullet wireless or oppo enco m 32 as they are way costly and if you have good budget then go for it but i bet u ll never regreat ordering boat 255 pro +,5.0,4

Sound Quality - 7/10 Bass Quality - 5/10 Battery quality 10/10* Build Quality - 6/10 Design Quality - 6/10 Comfort - 8/10 Fittings - 8/10 In honest review - Sound quality is loud(Not So Much) but bass quality is very low . If you switch from boat wired earphone (like boat 220) then you fill this low sound quality & bass quality. I think need to fix this bass quality ... make it more then high for batter sound experience. Battery quality is so so so good. Use 5days(7-8hour/day) continuously at that time there was 10 percent battery. Call connection & noise cancellation are perfectly working. I haven't see no issues in this neckband . Build quality is ok ok . Not so good, not so bad. Comfort is very good . No issues with me . Earbuds is comfortable for me . Atlast .... Overall best neckband for this price . Need to improve bass quality little more otherwise it is good enough . But use of any good external equaliser app from playstore solve this problem . I love this product so much .",5.0,17

flipkart,OnePlus Nord Buds CE Truly Wireless Bluetooth Headset,4.1,Pretty good,"Delivered on Sep 12th, now it's 22nd. I am a person who still wants to hear the surrounding while on earphone. This is the reason I go for this type of earpiece. I FOUND another way of wearing it - INVERTED - Use any side of the earpiece in either your left or right ear. Take the left earpiece, invert it and use it for your Right ear, and vice versa. I called this INVERTED. It's my invention - never seen anyone saying it or using it that way. TRY IT! Here are my views during this time. Let me list in points my observation, it can be a good or not that good. 1. It looks good and sleek. The built quality is very good. 2. Sound (bass) quality is not the best, but looking at the form factor (half in), it is very good. I need the earpod, not entirely for music, but for work and call as well. It fits me very well. 3. You can use only one side of the earpod, which I feel very convenient looking at the battery life. Talking about the battery life, it is decent enough with the case. 4. Call is crisp and clear. You can take calls in only one or both the earpod. I really have no idea about noise cancellation on this earphone. 5. Connection is one of the best I have seen. It's superfast. I usually connect to my laptop or phone. I have no problem switching it. 6. One small think I like: It connects automatically when opening the case. 7. Low battery warning is just a beep, it some sound only. I kind of like it, because the previous one I have has a voice warning, kind of annoying. 8. No light on the earpiece. I like it actually. There are lights in most bluetooth earphones/earpod which tends to get very bright in the dark. Let me list some of the not so ideal. 1. The touch control: This is the biggest upset I have. It's only double tap for Next/accept/reject/end. Really? No other control? What about single tap, triple tab, and other functions such as previous, pause/play? I am not sure if I am missing something. Well, I couldn't find one looking through the manuals. 2. The 20 hrs playtime claim is including the charging case, mind you! At first, I was happy thinking I should be able to use at least 10hrs without charging - NOPE. The earpiece last about 5-6 hrs, and you need to put back in the charging case. Fortunately, only one piece can be use at a time, and I switch them. 3. No Multipoint - I want to use for my laptop and phone. I wish I can connect to both at the same time and almost regret that I didn't check this feature while buying. It makes up somehow due to easy connectivity. I have to deal with it. 4. No battery indicator on charging case. I would love if the light indicates the battery charged state. The case indicator turns green when you charge it. That's about it. I wish if the indicator turns red to green (or something like that) to identify the battery percentage of the earpod when putting it in the case. Now, if you put almost depleted battery earpiece inside the case, it turn off. It does charge them, but nothing indicates it. 5. My right ear tends to get pain on wearing it. I am not sure if that's a design flow, but my left ear is fine, though. This is the reason I invented the INVERTED. Looking at the not so ideal points, I feel that the price is on a higher side. That said, It is a good product and is very satisfied with it. If you are going to use for Music only, I don't believe this is the best. But you would like to use like I did, sometimes music, sometimes calls, and still would like to hear the surrounding, GO for it.",4.0,21

flipkart,OnePlus Nord Buds CE Truly Wireless Bluetooth Headset,4.1,Worth every penny,"The product gives a good in-hand feel and OnePlus has maintained its quality regardless of the price. The connection of the lid to the case feels a bit weak but it's a very slight issue. Battery backup is average although other earbuds in the segment give more battery backup. The connectivity is simple and fast (Used in both iPhone and Android) and even the app is smooth and elegant. I think these earbuds have the segment's best sound quality. It gives 4 modes in its app; although I just use 2 modes (Bass/Balanced). There is a slight (very very slight) latency in the controls on the earbuds which is not that noticeable. Overall, this product is worth for its price and gives its best for what you pay.",5.0,16

The build quality is good, but if you have a larger head, then this will be very tight, like very tight, so should go for other options. If you are buying a bt headset with a mic for the first time then let me warn you that, you cant use your mic and listen to sound at the same time, that is because this headset use BT 4.2, which is somewhat outdated considering today's standards, so basically, BT either receives input (The music you are listening to) or transmits output (your voice through you mic). Another reason to not buy this for gaming, as well as  office work. This product is best for basic day to day usage, like listening to music or watching YouTube.

You get Aux Cable with 3.5mm connectors on both end and a Charging cable with USB to Micro USB connector. It charges up pretty fast, say in an hour or so. But there's no indicator when charging is completed, it's red when charging but when full, it's still red. You have to switch on or off or unplug and replug to know charging condition. In wired mode, the sound in muffled. Microphone doesn't work in wired mode. In Bluetooth mode, connection gets distorted every few seconds, but it's not repetative, but quite random. Sometimes there's a pause every 20 seconds, sometimes every 15 seconds and so on. That's the biggest drawback. Also, Bluetooth feature gets distortion and at times completely disconnects from any device if there's much movement, like brisk walking, climbing stairs. You'll have to maintain a standard cable length distance from device when using this headset in bluetooth mode, or else distortion is inevitable. It's made of Plastic, and the headset adjustment area(the place which slides down or goes up to adjust to your head size) is sloppy. It's made of plastic grooves and after 2-3 adjustment, the headsets starts sliding down on its own weight. That's another drawback. I replaced the product to check if these drawbacks were isolated incidents but to my surprise, they weren't. The replacement headset had the same problems. This is not a noise cancelling headset, but by design, headset earcups are supposed to cover our ears, hence a false notion of noise cancellation by default. But active Noise cancellation and Environmental Noise cancellation are completely different things. This headset has none of those, but if your ears are small, then the headset cups are gonna completely cover them and give a false hope of noise cancellation.

You get Aux Cable with 3.5mm connectors on both end and a Charging cable with USB to Micro USB connector. It charges up pretty fast, say in an hour or so. But there's no indicator when charging is completed, it's red when charging but when full, it's still red. You have to switch on or off or unplug and replug to know charging condition. In wired mode, the sound in muffled. Microphone doesn't work in wired mode. In Bluetooth mode, connection gets distorted every few seconds, but it's not repetative, but quite random. Sometimes there's a pause every 20 seconds, sometimes every 15 seconds and so on. That's the biggest drawback. Also, Bluetooth feature gets distortion and at times completely disconnects from any device if there's much movement, like brisk walking, climbing stairs. You'll have to maintain a standard cable length distance from device when using this headset in bluetooth mode, or else distortion is inevitable. It's made of Plastic, and the headset adjustment area(the place which slides down or goes up to adjust to your head size) is sloppy. It's made of plastic grooves and after 2-3 adjustment, the headsets starts sliding down on its own weight. That's another drawback. I replaced the product to check if these drawbacks were isolated incidents but to my surprise, they weren't. The replacement headset had the same problems. This is not a noise cancelling headset, but by design, headset earcups are supposed to cover our ears, hence a false notion of noise cancellation by default. But active Noise cancellation and Environmental Noise cancellation are completely different things. This headset has none of those, but if your ears are small, then the headset cups are gonna completely cover them and give a false hope of noise cancellation.

First about the product itself.  It's sound quality is very good. Bass lovers will just love it. Average mids and high.  It lasts about 25-28 hrs with a full charge. Also tested on heavy rain while driving ( don't worry , earphones were not plugged in.. 😂). It was on my neck. But there was no water ingress. Now the major problem kicks in . After 10 months left speaker was not working. So , I registered a complaint on boat website. They picked my earphone for replacement.  But later it was replaced with "" rockerz 255 pro "" instead of "" rockerz 255 pro + "" . Why ? Even after a lot of conversations with boat support they didn't provide me my model . Now I've to stick with these low quality ear peace. Hence , Try to avoid boat online support for warranty claim and better visit physical service entre. Good luck. Edit : After having conversation with higher authorities on Twitter, they replaced the same with my model . Edit 2 : from first day onwards after receiving the replacement product I was in doubt that the sound quality was decreased a lot. So, again I replaced with the authorized service centre for flat ( no/ very low bass)  sound.  But the 2nd replacement is also same. I thought I've some issues with my ear lol 😆 . But today when I listened to my friends rockerz 255 pro + (same as mine but the retail unit) I was surprised and thankful too . My ear was not damaged .
